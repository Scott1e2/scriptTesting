#This script uses the PyMongo library to connect to a MongoDB database and insert the data from a CSV file into a specific collection. You will need to replace "username", "password", "host", "port" with the appropriate credentials to connect to your MongoDB instance, "database_name" with the name of your MongoDB database, and "collection_name" with the name of the collection you want to insert the data into.

#You also need to install PyMongo library by running !pip install pymongo
