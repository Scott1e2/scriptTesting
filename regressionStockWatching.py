#This script uses a linear regression model to predict stock prices based on historical data, and then makes decisions about buying or selling the stock based on those predictions. It's important to note that this script is for demonstration purposes only and may not work as is in your specific use case. The stock market is highly dynamic and there are many factors that can affect the stock prices, making it hard to predict the outcome.
